Welcome to TorchRay
===================

The *TorchRay* package implements several visualization methods for deep
convolutional neural networks using PyTorch. In this release, TorchRay focuses
on *attribution*, namely the problem of determining which part of the input,
e.g., an image, is responsible for the value computed by a neural network.

*TorchRay* is research-oriented. In addition to implementing well known
techniques form the literature, it provides code for reproducing results that
appear in several papers, and can thus be a tool for *reproducible research*.

For downloads, installation instructions, and access to the source code
